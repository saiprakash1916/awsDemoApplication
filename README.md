# AWS Demo Application

This repository contains a demo project where I practiced working with Amazon S3 buckets.

I created two API endpoints:

**File Upload API** – uploads a file to an S3 bucket (/upload)

**File Download API** – retrieves a file from an S3 bucket (/download/{fileName})

**File Delete API** – Delete a file from an S3 bucket (/delete/{fileName})

The application runs locally on port 8080.
